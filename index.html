      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
        Patrick spent most of the profile creation period unsuccessfully attempting to add a background image of the Carina Nebula. He doesn't have a great explanation as to why he chose that image/celestial body, but he knows that he didn't do it correctly.

        <h5>Father, Yogi the Berner</h5>
        <p>Patrick and his fiancee, Whitney, have a 1.5 year old Bernese Mountain Dog named Yogi. Yogi enjoys eating any and all forms of food, half-assedly attempting to climb into cars and sniffing the butts of other canines. Yogi is the answer to life's important question, "Why can't we have nice things?"</p>
